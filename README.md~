# Pytorch installation instructions

This is a step by step instruction for installing and running the code in PyTorch for the final project in the course CS7GV1 - Computer Vision

## Data

You can download the data from the following links
* [Training images](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip)
* Testing images (to be updated soon)

## Prerequisites

```
Ubuntu (14 or higher)
Cuda 8
Cudnn
python-pip
virtualenv (optional)
docker (optional) 
```
## Installation

### Step 1 : Installing Cuda
Download CUDA 8 and Cudnn library from the following links. The default website takes one to CUDA 9. The previous versions can be found in "Legacy Releases" under "Additional Resources".
* [Cuda 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive)
* [Cudnn 7 for cuda 8](https://drive.google.com/a/tcd.ie/file/d/1JNKUnIRbAnZ49wSiJgou4zz9CQiamR8J/view?usp=sharing)
For CUDA, follow the installation instructions from the website. For Cudnn, they ask you to create an account to be able to download the library. You don't have to since we have downloaded it already for you. You can just follow the installation intrctions mentioned here
### Step 2 : Creating a virtual environment
### Step 3 : Installing pytorch
### Step 4 : Installing dependencies

### using a docker container

## Running the script
Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
